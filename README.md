# Blockchain-based-System-for-Sneaker-Authentication-and-Lifecycle-Management

## 📖 Description
This project demonstrates a blockchain-powered system for verifying the authenticity and provenance of sneakers throughout their lifecycle.  
Manufacturers mint NFTs that represent each sneaker pair, ensuring traceability and tamper-proof ownership records. Retailers and customers can verify authenticity using a blockchain-backed system integrated with a React frontend and Node.js backend.

**Tech Stack:**
- Blockchain Framework: Hyperledger Fabric  
- Smart Contract Language: Solidity  
- Frontend: ReactJS  
- Backend: Node.js  
- Storage: IPFS
